Imagine taking a book (The Time Machine) and determining the probability that each characer occurs. 
You would probably find that spaces are the most common, that the character “e” isfairly common, and that the character “q” is rather uncommon.
After completing this level 0 analysis, you would be able to produce random The Time Machine text based on character probabilities.
Each level the output would get more realistic. You could now produce some randomly generated The Time Machine text by picking a character to begin with,
and then always choosing the next character based on the previous one and the probabilities revealed by the analysis.
